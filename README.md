# christmas-exchange-app

Quick program I made for this Christmas gift exchange with my family. 
We are all living in different cities, so the old technique of pulling our names out of a cup wasn't gonna cut it, so I programed it. 
The app receives the names and email addresses of all attendees to the exchange and computes a feasible exchange, and sends an email to each person telling them who to get a present for. 
The program assumes you have a gmail account from which to send all the emails.
For it to work, you'll need Python (I'm using 3.6) and the smtplib library.
